I'm pretty confident the answer is Paris. No other city comes to mind as the capital of France. I should make sure there isn't a recent change, but I don't think so.

I know it's a country in South Asia, bordered by India, China, Afghanistan, and Iran. The main cities I can think of are Lahore, Karachi, Islamabad, and maybe Peshawar. I remember hearing that Islamabad is the capital, but I'm not entirely sure. Wait, wasn't there a time when the capital was different? Maybe it was moved?\n",

So Pakistan probably did something similar.\n",

So yes, that must be the capital.\n",

Similarly, in Pakistan, Karachi is the largest city, but Islamabad is the capital. That seems right.
